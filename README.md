# Office 365 Integration for Home Assistant

*This is a fork of the original integration by @PTST which has now been archived.*

This integration enables:
1. Getting and creating calendar events
1. Getting emails from your inbox using one of two available sensor types (e-mail and query)
1. Sending emails via the notify.o365_email service
1. Getting presence from Teams (not for personal accounts)
1. Getting the latest chat message from Teams (not for personal accounts)
1. Getting and creating To-Do tasks
1. Setting Auto Reply/Out of Office response

This project would not be possible without the wonderful [python-o365 project](https://github.com/O365/python-o365).

## [Buy Me A ~~Coffee~~ Beer üçª](https://buymeacoffee.com/rogtp)
I work on this integration because I like things to work well for myself and others. Whilst I have now made significant changes to the integration, it would not be as it stands today without the major work to create it put in by @PTST. Please don't feel you are obligated to donate, but of course it is appreciated.
