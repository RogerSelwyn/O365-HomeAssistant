# Deprecation Notice:
The Calendar, Mail Notification, Teams and To Do entities and services are now deprecated in the O365 integration. Development on O365 has now stopped unless a change is required to support migration to the MS365 integrations.

Details on how to migrate to the new MS365 integrations can be found here - [Migration](https://rogerselwyn.github.io/O365-HomeAssistant/migration.html)

# Note: 

This integration is very close to EOL. I have already created integrations which will replace it - MS365-Calendar/Mail/Teams/ToDo, these can now be found on HACS. 

Many will have seen a warning in the logs - `Detected that custom integration 'o365' uses 'async_config_entry_first_refresh', which is only supported for coordinators with a config entry and will stop working in Home Assistant 2025.11` - this further forces the EOL due to a change in HA Core, which means that the integration will cease to work after the 2025.11 HA release without really significant re-work. Because this integration is setup via YAML, it does not have a `config_entry`, the replacements listed above do.

# Office 365 Integration for Home Assistant

*This is a fork of the original integration by @PTST which has now been archived.*

This integration enables:
1. Getting and creating calendar events
1. Getting emails from your inbox using one of two available sensor types (e-mail and query)
1. Sending emails via the notify.o365_email service
1. Getting presence from Teams (not for personal accounts)
1. Getting the latest chat message from Teams (not for personal accounts)
1. Getting and creating To-Do tasks
1. Setting Auto Reply/Out of Office response

This project would not be possible without the wonderful [python-o365 project](https://github.com/O365/python-o365).

## [Buy Me A Beer üçª](https://buymeacoffee.com/rogtp)
I work on this integration because I like things to work well for myself and others. Whilst I have now made significant changes to the integration, it would not be as it stands today without the major work to create it put in by @PTST. Please don't feel you are obligated to donate, but of course it is appreciated.
