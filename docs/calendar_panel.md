Creation and deletion of events is possible via the Calendar Panel introduced in HA 2023.1. This UI allows you to create recurring events, which is not possible via the HA services methods. 

If you choose to delete 'Delete All Future Events', it will delete the whole series not just future events. This is due to the differences between O365 and the iCal specification that the core calendar is built on.
