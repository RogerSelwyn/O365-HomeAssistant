# Office 365 Integration for Home Assistant

This integration enables:
1. Getting and creating calendar events
2. Getting emails from your inbox using one of two available sensor types (e-mail and query)
3. Sending emails via the notify.o365_email service
4. Getting presence from Teams (not for personal accounts)
5. Getting the latest chat message from Teams (not for personal accounts)
6. Getting and creating To-Dos

This project would not be possible without the wonderful [python-o365 project](https://github.com/O365/python-o365).
