# Office 365 Integration for Home Assistant

*This is a fork of the original integration by @PTST which has now been archived.*

This integration enables:
1. Getting and creating calendar events from O365.
2. Getting emails from your inbox using one of two available sensor types (e-mail and query).
3. Sending emails via the notify.o365_email service.
4. Getting presence from Teams (not for personal accounts)
5. Getting the latest chat message from Teams (not for personal accounts)

This project would not be possible without the wonderful [python-o365 project](https://github.com/O365/python-o365).
