  * Status - For a status_sensor
  * Chat - For a chat_sensor
  * ToDo - For a todo_sensor
  * Group Calendar - For a manually added Group calendar
  * AutoReply - For Auto reply/Out of Office message configuration


  If you intend to send emails use calendar update functionality, then set [enable_update](./installation_and_configuration.md#configuration_variables) at the top level to `true`. For To-do List set [enable_update](installation_and_configuration.md#todo_lists) to true. Then for any sensor type, add the relevant `ReadWrite` permission as denoted by a `Y` in the update column.

**Note** It should be noted that these are the permissions that are requested at authentication time (as appropriate for each sensor configured). When `enable_update` is configured to `true` all the associated `ReadWrite` permissions are requested as well, however you do not need to add `ReadWrite` for any sensor type where you do not what update permissions, it will still act as a Read Only sensor. This excludes the AutoReply option which is only `ReadWrite`.

For example, permissions as below (and with `enable_update` set to `true`) will create calendar sensors, create chat sensors, and create auto reply enable/disable services but will not enable create/modify/remove/respond services:
```json
 "scope": [
  "Calendars.Read",
  "Chat.Read",
  "MailboxSettings.ReadWrite",
  "User.Read",
 ]
```

## Changing Features and Permissions
If you decide to enable new features in the integration, or decide to change from read only to read/write, you will very likely get a warning message similar to the following in your logs.

`Minimum required permissions not granted: ['Tasks.Read', ['Tasks.ReadWrite']]`

You will need to delete the relevant token from the `<config>/o365_storage/.O365-token-cache` directory. When you restart HA, you will then be prompted to re-authenticate with O365 which will store a new token with the new permission.
